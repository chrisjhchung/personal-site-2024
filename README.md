# Personal Website 2024 (WIP)

This is the code for my personal website (chrisjhchung.com). Currently it's a work in progress. 

## Idea behind the site

I like the idea of having an interactive site. The idea behind this site is that you (the user) can slowly unlock more parts of the site (and at the same time learn more about me). There will be tons of easter eggs to find, and all of them are fair (No hidden command that you wouldn't be able to find)
