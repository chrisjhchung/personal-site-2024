Accessibility is a concept that I'd known about for a long time, but not something I'd ever given too much thought or care about. I only recently learned that a11y is a numeronym for accessibility. I also only recently learned what a [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) is.

I think Accessibility is really important, and I have a lot to say. As such, I will split this out into multiple parts. This first part aims to introduce the topic. 

Why do we care about accessibility? Accessible design can be seen everywhere, not just online, think about the tactile paving that you see on the floor. Did you ever stop and wonder what those different textures were for? Did you even notice?

So, what is accessibility? The first thing that comes up when you Google it is:

<Note>
a design process in which the needs of people with disabilities are specifically considered.
</Note>

Whilst this isn't necessarily wrong, it's a very naive and oversimplified understanding of the topic. I think if there's one thing you take away from this post, it's that accessible design is for **everyone**.

I'm going to repeat that point, so it sticks:

Accessible design is for **everyone**.

Now that I've made that point, let me explain what I mean. When you hear accessibility, people with disabilities are usually the first thing people think about. And that is a great consideration. Accessible design allows us to share content and overcome boundaries that can arise from:

<Note>
- Cognitive and learning disabilities
- Visual impairment
- Speech inputs
- Hearing impairment
- Motor and dexterity
</Note>

But people often forget that accessible design also helps:

<Note>
- People with temporary limitations (Sprained wrist for example)
- Hardware limitations (Access to internet, lack of a working mouse)
- Environmental (The sun's glare against your phone's screen, yes that is covered by accessible design)
</Note>

Hopefully you noticed something, anyone can have the above limitations. More than that, **you've** probably had one of those limitations at one point in your life. 

Implementing accessibility correctly not only benefits individuals with disabilities but also brings additional advantages. It's like receiving a bonus for doing the right thing! 

One significant benefit is ensuring compliance with laws and regulations that promote equal access and opportunities for all. For instance, the NSW government have the [Disability Discrimination Act (1992)](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/acts/1992-102.pdf), which aims to provide equal access to information and services for everyone. By following these guidelines, you not only avoid legal issues but also enhance the credibility and reputation of your work.

Implementing accessibility also has the added advantage of promoting the use of semantic HTML and/or markup. This, in turn, facilitates the process of web indexes discovering and comprehending your site more effectively. Consequently, your site will experience an enhancement in search engine optimization (SEO), ultimately leading to a broader audience for your content. Like I said, you can get some nice freebies by considering Accessibility!

Now, am I saying that everything has to be 100% accessible? No. Do I think that everything can/should be 100% accessible? Also no. 

I'm simply advocating that as developers and designers, we need to understand and consider accessible design in our works and we shouldn't look at it as a burden. 

Hopefully I've done a decent job at explaining why we should care about accessibility. In upcoming sections, I'm going to break down how we can implement accessible designs in our work. What patterns we should adopt and strive to use more, and what patterns we should avoid.
