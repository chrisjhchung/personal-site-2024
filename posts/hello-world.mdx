Boring title. I know. But that's how all firsts things are supposed to be called right?

Anyways, another year, another new personal website. This one is definitely more... simple than what I usually create. So, why the change? 

The last site I made was in 2018, before I had any idea what I was doing. That makes it sound like I've figured out what I'm doing, rest assured, that's not the case. I like my old site, it's simple, it's fun, it's got some cool features, but it's not representative of my skills. I mean, just look at this:

```html
<div style="border-top: 3px solid rgb(255, 214, 0); background: rgba(17, 17, 17, 0.1); backdrop-filter: blur(100px); display: flex; z-index:99999999999999">
    <a href="/" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 20px;">HOME</a>
    <a href="/about" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 20px;">ABOUT ME</a>
</div>
```

... yes, that is all inline styles. Yes, that is a `z-index` of basically infinity. But I digress, the point of this article isn't about tearing apart my old site (but I intend on doing that in the future), this post is about this site. 

The point of this site is to keep things simple. Yes, I want to show off all the fancy new tech I'm playing around with, but more than that I want to code in public. 

I've always admired people who are willing to share their processes, especially when it's not clean or polished. Which is exactly what you can expect to find here. Bottom of the shelf, stay in the kitchen quality content. But within all that, I hope to share my learning process and other things I find interesting with the rest of the world. 

Anyways, I've blabbed on enough. Basically, just wanted to say welcome to this circus, hope you enjoy the show!
