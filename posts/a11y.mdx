Accessibility is a concept that I'd known about for a long time, but not something I'd ever given too much thought or care about. I only recently learnt that a11y is numeronym for accessibility. I also only recently learnt what a [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) is.

Why do we care about accessibility? Accessible design can be seen everywhere, not just online, think about the tactile paving that you see on the floor. Did you ever stop and wonder what those different textures were for? Did you even notice?

So, what is accessibility? The first thing that comes up when you Google it is:

>  a design process in which the needs of people with disabilities are specifically considered.

Whilst this isn't neccessarily wrong, it's a very naive a over simplified understanding of the topic. I think if there's one thing you take away from this post, it's that accessible design is for **everyone**.

I'm going to repeat that point, so it sticks:

Accessible design is for **everyone**.

Now that I've made that point, let me explain what I mean. When you hear accessibility, people with disabilities are usually the first thing people think about. And that is a great consideration. Accessible design allows us to share content and overcome boundaries that can arise from:

- Cognitive and learning disabilities
- Visual impairment
- Speech inputs
- Hearing impairment
- Motor and dexterity

But people often forget that accessible design also helps:

- People with temporary limitations (Sprained wrist for example)
- Hardware limitations (Access to internet, lack of a working mouse)
- Environmental (The sun's glare against your phone's screen, yes that is covered by accessible design)
